    # Weather Dashboard
Weather Dashboard! Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and serverside API's.

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard. Users search for a city, and are presented with the current day's weather as well as a five day forecast. A history of past searches is displayed.

This project served as an opportunity to practice the implementation of serverside API's, DOM manipulation and algorithm design.

## Installation

The project can be accessed at: https://niktern.github.io/Weather-Dashboard-App/

## Usage

Type a city whose weather you would like to see into the searchbar. Then click the search button to see the weather for that city.

If an invalid input is given by the user, nothing will happen.

Upon successfully searching for a city, the city will appear below the searchbar as a button. This is the city history. Clicking on a historical search will pull up the weather for that city.

A bug exists in the API, which is discussed in the 'API-Bug-Notes' file.
